Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests
1.Imported Libraries
Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
2.Loaded and Preprocessed Data
Checked for null values (none found).
Visualized correlations using a heatmap.
3.Split the Data
Used an 80/20 split for training and testing.
4.Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
Accuracy: 50%
Visualized the tree structure.
5.Analyzed Overfitting
Trained models with varying max_depth values.
Observed accuracy remained stable (low) due to small dataset.
6.Trained a Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 50%
Extracted and visualized feature importances.
7.Performed Cross-Validation
CV scores: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]
Mean score: 0.60
